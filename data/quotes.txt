If you want to test your memory, try to recall what you were worrying about one year ago today. 
You gotta commit. You've gotta go out there and improvise and you've gotta be completely unafraid to die. You've got to be able to take a chance to die. And you have to die lots. You have to die all the time. 
Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains: They are fictions you perceive as reality. Choose to see through them. Choose to let them go.

The tennis ball doesn't know how old I am. The ball doesn't know if I'm a man or a woman or if I come from a communist country or not. Sport has always broken down these barriers.

Vulnerability is not winning or losing; it's having the courage to show up and be seen when we have no control over the outcome.

Successful people appear to be traveling along one continual, successful road. What is not apparent is the perseverance it takes following each defeat to keep you on that road. No one I know of has ever experienced one success after another without defeats, failures, disappointments, and frustrations galore along the way. Learning to overcome those times of agony is what separates the winners from the losers. 
On and on, like we're living on a broken record. Hope is strong, but misery's a little quicker. Sit and we wait and we drown there. Thinking why bother play when it's unfair. They say life's a waste. I say they lack belief. They tell me luck will travel. I tell them that's why I got feet. Left, right, left, right. Moving along to the pulse of a heartbeat. This could be the last chance you have to fly. Do you like the ground? Want it to pass you by? Man you had it all when you were just a kid. Or do you even remember who you were back then? What do you want in life? Will you be twice as strong? What would you sacrifice? What are you waiting on? Don't stop. March on.

It isn't what you have, or who you are, or where you are, or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about. 
When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life.

We're not talking about the same thing, he said. For you the world is weird because if you're not bored with it you're at odds with it. For me the world is weird because it is stupendous, awesome, mysterious, unfathomable; my interest has been to convince you that you must accept responsibility for being here, in this marvelous world, in this marvelous desert, in this marvelous time.

When something seems difficult, dare to do it anyway. When life seems to beat you down, dare to fight back. When there seems to be no hope, dare to find some. When you're feeling tired, dare to keep going. When times are tough, dare to be tougher. When love hurts you, dare to love again. When someone is hurting, dare to help them heal. When another is lost, dare to help them find the way. When a friend falls, dare to be the first to extend a hand. When you cross paths with another, dare to make them smile. When you feel great, dare to help someone else feel great too. When the day has ended, dare to feel as you've done your best. Dare to be the best you can. At all times, dare to be!

I want to say somewhere: I've tried to be forgiving. And yet there were times in my life, whole years, when anger got the better of me. Ugliness turned me inside out. There was a certain satisfaction in bitterness. I courted it. It was standing outside, and I invited it in.
I didn't grasp that the shadows that sometimes crossed her face weren't momentary clouds passing in front of the sun. Her deep silences were more than daydreams. And her habit of standing with her arms wrapped around her ribs was a way of holding herself together.
Do your own thing on your own terms and get what you came here for. 
Know who you are. Know what you want. Know what you deserve and don't settle for less.

People will show you who they are, but we ignore it because we want them to be who we want them to be.

Don't let us forget that the causes of human actions are usually immeasurably more complex and varied than our subsequent explanations of them.
I truly respect people who stay strong, even when they have every right to break down. 
You think too much because you are seeking for something beautiful inside yourself. 
It is difficult to demand change in our world, when we demand no change in ourselves. 
Never wish them pain. That's not who you are. If they caused you pain they must have pain inside. Wish them healing. 
If you don't want to sink, you better figure out how to swim.

Everything starts with little steps.
I must not fear. Fear is the mind
There are good people and bad people in the world. The ones who start the fires, and the ones that put them out. 
Listen to the people who love you. Believe that they are worth living for even when you don't believe it. Seek out the memories depression takes away and project them into the future. Be brave; be strong; take your pills. Exercise because it's good for you even if every step weighs a thousand pounds. Eat when food itself disgusts you. Reason with yourself when you have lost your reason. 
There is nothing perfect, there is only life. 
I refuse to let the past find me here.
I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.
I'm a simple person who hides a thousand feelings behind the happiest smile. 
My personality is who I am. My attitude depends on who you are. 
I shall go on shining as a brilliantly meaningless figure in a meaningless world.
Goodnight and great love to you. We see the same stars.

The soul always knows what to do to heal itself, the challenge is to silence the mind. 
That's the problem with drinking, I thought, as I poured myself a drink. If something bad happens you drink in an attempt to forget; if something good happens you drink in order to celebrate; and if nothing happens you drink to make something happen.

When you complain you make yourself a victim. Leave the situation, change the situation or accept it. All else is madness. 
People change and forget to tell each other. 
If you want to be happy, you have to be happy on purpose. When you wake up, you can't just wait to see what kind of day you'll have. You have to decide what kind of day you'll have. 
You may not see it today or tomorrow, but you will look back in a few years and be absolutely awed by how every little thing added up and brought you somewhere wonderful. 
Here at last is her smile: burn it into your memory; you won't see it often.
We need people in our lives with whom we can be as open as possible. To have real conversations with people may seem like such a simple, obvious suggestion, but it involves courage and risk. 
Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do to get something better.
You can't buy a clean conscience.
If you can't do anything about it, then let it go. Don't be a prisoner to things you can't change.

I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I needed to be.
If you don't stand for something you will fall for anything.
Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog it's too dark to read.

I can be someone's and still be my own.
Let someone love you just the way you are as flawed as you might be, as unattractive as you sometimes feel, and as unaccomplished as you think you are.

When there's a fresh wound in your heart, keep it open until it heals. Air it out. Understand it. Dive into it. Be fierce enough to become it. If you ignore it, it won't be able to breath. If you ignore it, it will merely deepen, spread, and resurface later, wanting to release. And when later happens, it will hurt even more; because when later happens, you won't know what you're bleeding for... Remain open to feel free.

Even though I don't know what tomorrow will bring, I'm going to hold my head high, think positive, and expect the best. 
Everyone makes mistakes in life but that doesn't mean they have to pay for them for the rest of their life. Sometimes good people make bad choices. That doesn't mean they're bad. It means they're human. 
Real tears are not those that fall from the eyes and cover the face, but those that fall from the heart and cover the soul.

You will find that it is necessary to let things go; simply for the reason that they are heavy. 
I think that you find your own way. You have your own rules. You have your own understanding of yourself, and that's what you're going to count on. In the end, it's what feels right to you â€¦ Not what anybody else tells you.

In life you're going to be left out, talked about, lied to and used, but you have to decide who's worth your tears and who's not.

Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs. 
The battles that count aren't the ones for gold medals. The struggles within yourself the invisible battles inside all of us that's where it's at.

She did not need much, wanted very little. A kind word, sincerity, fresh air, clean water, a garden, kisses, books to read, sheltering arms, a cozy bed, and to love and be loved in return. 
One of the most amazing things that can happen is finding someone who sees everything you are and won't let you be anything less. They see the potential in you. They see endless possibilities. And through their eyes, you start to see yourself the same way. As someone who matters. As someone who can make a difference in this world.

It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime.

We're more than our mistakes. We're more than what people expect of us.
What about when someone doesn't need a shoulder? What if they need the arms?
Perhaps most of all, though, you deserve to be okay. You deserve to know that a day in which you can just barely get out of bed because you are sad, or sick, or simply not ready to see the outside is not the end of the world. You deserve to know that moments of weakness do not make you fundamentally weak, only fundamentally human, and that sometimes we're not going to be effusively happy, and that is okay. 
Stop trying to figure it all out. Often the answers come to us when we least expect it.

I am hopelessly in love with a memory. An echo from another time, another place. 
Self-worth is so vital to your happiness. If you don't feel good about you, it's hard to feel good about anything else. 
The way to love someone is to lightly run your finger over that person's soul until you find a crack and then gently pour your love into that crack. 
I'm never ashamed of my words. My words are me and how I feel. If that's a crime, then they should not have given me a mind and heart. 
People will stare. Make it worth their while. 
Believe you can and you're halfway there.

Someone who is worthy of your love will never put you in a situation where you feel you must sacrifice your dignity, your integrity, or your self worth to be with them. 
The trouble is if you don't spend your life yourself, other people spend it for you.
Everybody isn't going to love you. Most people don't even love themselves. 
Do what makes you happy, be with who makes you smile, laugh as much as you breathe, and love as long as you live. 
Whatever you do, good or bad, people will always have something negative to say. 
Funny how life had its little ways of surprising you. Little quirks of fate.
Don't waste the rest of your time here worrying about other peopleâ€”unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You'll be too preoccupied with what so
The world will knock you down plenty. You don't need to be doing it to yourself. 
You always have the choice to be happy. Learn to understand the purpose of bumps in the road, grow from them and stay positive. 
Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it. 
A man often meets his destiny on the road he took to avoid it. 
Listen to a person when they look at you, not just when they're talking to you. 
Be nice to yourself. It's hard to be happy when someone is mean to you all the time. 
Everyone needs at least one friend who understands what we do not say. 
I've spent so much time in my head and my heart that I forgot to live in my body. 
I once told her I wasn't good at anything. She told me survival is a talent. 
Don't listen to yourself; listen to the advice that you give others. 
As long as you look for someone else to validate who you are by seeking their approval, you are setting yourself up for disaster. You have to be whole and complete in yourself. No one can give you that. You have to know who you are what others say is irrelevant. 
But eyes are blind. You have to look with the heart.
I like to listen. I have learnt a lot from listening carefully. Most people never listen. 
I'm not afraid of death; I just don't want to be there when it happens. 
She took a step and didn't want to take any more, but she did. 
I will breathe. I will think of solutions. I will not let my worry control me. I will not let my stress level break me. I will simply breathe. I will be OK because I don't quit. 
Taking one's chances is like taking a bath, because sometimes you end up feeling comfortable and warm, and sometimes there is something terrible lurking around that you cannot see until it is too late and you can do nothing else but scream and cling to a plastic duck.
Meet me in outer space. We could spend the night. Watch the earth come up. I've grown tired of that place. Won't you come with me? We could start again.
I was quiet; but I was not blind. 
Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create. 
Sometimes it is the smallest thing that saves us: the weather growing cold, a child's smile, and a cup of excellent coffee. 
Put your thoughts to sleep. Do not let them cast a shadow over the moon of your heart. Let go of thinking. 
Summer is near and things will be okay again. 
You deserve someone who answers. 
It's better to be your genuine self, and have fewer of the right kinds of people in your life, than it is to surround yourself with those who only accept you as long as you conform to their idea of who you should be. 
I learned not to trust people; I learned not to believe what they say but to watch what they do. I learned to suspect that everyone is capable of living a lie. I came to believe that other people even when you think you know them well are ultimately unknowable. 
I'm afraid that if you look at a thing long enough, it loses all of its meaning. 
The truth is often a terrible weapon of aggression. It is possible to lie, and even to murder, with the truth. 
I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars. 
Sometimes you have to do what's best for you, not what's best for somebody else. 
Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option. 
We are products of our past but we don't have to be prisoners of it. 
Don't ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who are alive. 
Tomorrow is another chance. 
One of the hardest lessons in life is letting go. Whether it's guilt, love, anger, loss or betrayal, change is never easy. We fight to hold on and we fight to let go. 
Sometimes I find that music is so much more attractive than love. I don't knowâ€¦ It's like some kind of euphoria, that love can't bring to you. 
So please ask yourself: What would I do if I weren't afraid? And then go do it. 
Being positive isn't pretending that everything is good. It's seeing the good in everything. 
Millions of people can believe in you, and yet none of it matters if you don't believe in yourself. 
Courage doesn't mean you don't get afraid. Courage means you don't let fear stop you. 
The most important thing is to enjoy your life to be happy it's all that matters. 
Keep moving forward. 
I don't mind worriers,
In any given moment we have two options: To step forwards into growth or to step backwards into safety. 
You alone are enough. You have nothing to prove to anybody. 
Appreciate those who don't give up on you. 
Some hearts understand each other even in silence. 
If you light a lamp for someone else it will also brighten your path. 
I take much pleasure in being alone but there is also a strange warm grace in not being alone. 
The less I know the better. 
Love is not about sex, going on fancy dates, or showing off. It's about being with a person who makes you happy in a way nobody else can. 
The darkest nights produce the brightest stars. 
Sometimes people don't want to hear the truth because they don't want their illusions destroyed. 
There's really no shortcut to forgetting someone. You just have to endure missing them everyday until you don't anymore. 
Have patience with all things but first with yourself. Never confuse your mistakes with your value as a human being. You are perfectly valuable, creative, worthwhile person simply because you exist. 
It's all too much and not enough at the same time. 
It's never too late to change the direction that your life is going in. 
We cannot simply sit and stare at our wounds forever. We must stand up and move on to the next action.
Soft hearted people are not fools. They know what people did to them but they forgive them again and again because they have beautiful hearts. 
If the lights go out tomorrow, would you know? 
And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter â€” they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long.
The sad truth is the truth is sad. 
It is the things you cannot see coming that are strong enough to kill you. 
Becoming fearless isn't the point. That's impossible. It's learning how to control your fear, and how to be free from it, that's the point. 
Don't be so cool you can't cry. Don't be so smart you can't wonder. Don't be so set on your sunny days that you can't love thunder. 
Never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night. That is how galaxies are made. 
Flowers grow back even after the harshest winters. You will too. 
God gives every bird its food, but he does not throw it into its nest. 
Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We can't escape that damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other.
There is no way to happiness. Happiness is the way. 
Allow yourself to hope and believe again. Don't allow the memories from the past to spoil the present, or to rob you of a future. 
Those who dance will be called fools by those who cannot hear the music. 
At your absolute best, you still won't be good enough for the wrong person. At your worst, you'll still be worth it to the right person. 
Closing your eyes isn't going to change anything. Nothing's going to disappear just because you can't see what's going on. In fact, things will even be worse the next time you open your eyes. That's the kind of world we live in. Keep your eyes wide open. Only a coward closes his eyes. Closing your eyes and plugging up your ears won't make time stand still. 
You can't fix me. Let me have my bad days. 
Sometimes people say terrible things when they're scared. They don't mean to, but they can't help it. They lash out because if they can see that their words hurt someone else, it makes them feel as if they aren't completely powerless. 
You can't control how they treat you, but you can control if you accept it. 
The soul usually knows what to do to heal itself. The challenge is to silence the mind. 
Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself. 
However rare true love may be, it is less so than true friendship. 
Bad ideas make the best memories. 
You can't always wait for the perfect time. Sometimes you just have to jump. 
Always go too far, because that's where you'll find the truth. 
Don't wait until you've reached your goal to be proud of yourself. Be proud of every step you take towards reaching that goal. 
Let it hurt. Let it bleed. Let it heal. And let it go. 
Comparing yourself to others is an act of violence against your authentic self. 
Love yourself first and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world. 
No one can truly know what anyone thinks or feels. 
To the ones who still believe in dreams: Chase them. Chase them until you're out of breath. Then, keep running. 
Blowing out someone else's candle doesn't make yours shine any brighter. 
Let your heart lead you, do not be afraid, for there will be much to regret if reason and sense and fear are your only markers.
I'd rather be a failure at something I love than a success at something I hate. 
Some things are more precious because they don't last long.
Life has many ways of testing a person's will either by having nothing happen at all, or by having everything happen at once. 
To borrow against the trust someone has placed in you costs nothing at first. You get away with it, you take a little more and a little more until there is no more to draw on. Oddly, your hands should be full with all that taking but when you open them there's nothing there.
Don't listen to yourself. Listen to the advice you give others. 
I always find beauty in things that are odd and imperfect â€“ they are much more interesting. 
It's been very rare to have known you, very strange and wonderful. 
Highly sensitive people are too often perceived as weaklings or damaged goods. To feel intensely is not a symptom of weakness, it is the trademark of the truly alive and compassionate. It is not the empath who is broken, it is society that has become dysfunctional and emotionally disabled. There is no shame in expressing your authentic feelings. Those who are at times described as being a hot mess or having too many issues are the very fabric of what keeps the dream alive for a more caring, humane world. Never be ashamed to let your tears shine a light in this world. 
Everyone you meet always asks if you have a career, are married or own a house; as if life was some kind of grocery list. But nobody ever asks if you are happy. 
When you are attracted to people, it's because of the details. Their kindness. Their eyes. The fact that they can get you to laugh when you need it the most.
I don't know if you've ever noticed this, but first impressions are often entirely wrong. 
I am here, alone, at the end of the world. I reach out and touch nothing.
Help others without any reason and give without the expectation of receiving anything in return. 
We do not know the true value of our moments until they have undergone the test of memory. Like the images the photographer plunges into a golden bath, our sentiments take on color; and only then, after that recoil and that transfiguration, do we understand their real meaning and enjoy them in all their tranquil splendor.
I leave the house, I walk the streets, get melancholy, and come home again. 
Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured foreverâ€¦ It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything. 
It is a wise thing to be polite; consequently, it is a stupid thing to be rude. To make enemies by unnecessary and willful incivility, is just as insane a proceeding as to set your house on fire.
I simply can't relax. My mind is like a brook, always running, always seeking, always murmuring. 
Show me the most damaged parts of your soul, and I will show you how it still shines like gold. 
The world will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. 
Don't think about what can happen in a month. Don't think about what can happen in a year. Just focus on the 24 hours in front of you and do what you can to get closer to where you want to be. 
It is very frustrating not to be understood in this world. If you say one thing and keep being told that you mean something else, it can make you want to scream. But somewhere in the world there is a place for all of us. 
Either give me more wine or leave me alone. 
In this world, there are things you can only do alone, and things you can only do with somebody else. It's important to combine the two in just the right amount.
We could have been happy. I know that, and it is perhaps the hardest thing to know.
Most of us are gifted with the ability to see the monsters hidden within another, but are unable to see past them. It takes a special kind of person to see the light inside of every living being. 
People take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness. Just because they're not on your road doesn't mean they've gotten lost. 
I want to feel all there is to feel, he thought. Let me feel tired, now, let me feel tired. I mustn't forget, I'm alive, I know I'm alive, I mustn't forget it tonight or tomorrow or the day after that.
If you want to choose the pleasure of growth, prepare yourself for some pain. 
When we let go of our battles and open our heart to things as they are, then we come to rest in the present moment. This is the beginning and the end of spiritual practice. Only in this moment can we discover that which is timeless. Only here can we find the love that we seek. Love in the past is simply memory, and love in the future is fantasy. Only in the reality of the present can we love, can we awaken, can we find peace and understanding and connection with ourselves and the world. 
That's the way it is: If two people want to be together, they'll find a way. They'll forge a way.
Well, we all make mistakes, dear, so just put it behind you. We should regret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward into the future with us. 
It is brave to believe in even the slightest possibility that you may have what it takes to change the world, for it is often those with the most absurd and outrageous beliefs who make all the difference. 
The bravest thing you can ever do is to stay kind and soft, even when the world has been cruel to you. 
Forward is forward. You're taking steps every day to get to where you want to be, and it's enough. No matter how fast or slow you go, you're enough.
We know you're tired, tired and scared. Happens to everyone, okay? Just don't let your feet stop. 
I am tired. These people make me feel I have a hole in the middle of me.
I just want you to know that you're very special; and the only reason I'm telling you is that I don't know if anyone else ever has. 
Stars should not be seen alone. That's why there are so many. Two people should stand together and look at them. One person alone will surely miss the good ones. 
You are unique. You have different talents and abilities. You don't have to always follow in the footsteps of others. And most important, you should always remind yourself that you don't have to do what everyone else is doing and have a responsibility to develop the talents you have been given.
Nobody ever really knows how much anyone else is hurting. You could be standing next to somebody who is completely broken and you wouldn't even know it. That's why you should always try to be kind. 
I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy.
One of the risks of being quiet is that the other people can fill your silence with their own interpretation: You're bored. You're depressed. You're shy. You're stuck up. You're judgmental. When others can't read us, they write their own story â€” not always one we choose or that's true to who we are. 
Keep going. Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going. Tough situations build strong people in the end.
I am someone who thinks and feels much â€“ more than is reasonable. And that is all.
If you want to be happy, do not dwell in the past, don't worry about the future, focus on living fully in the present.
There is a time in life when you expect the world to be always full of new things. And then comes a day when you realize that is not how it will be at all. You see that life will become a thing made of holes. Absences. Losses. Things that were there and are no longer. And you realize, too, that you have to grow around and between the gaps, though you can put your hand out to where things were and feel that tense, shining dullness of the space where the memories are.
People think dreams aren't real just because they aren't made of matter, of particles. Dreams are real. But they are made of viewpoints, of images, of memories and puns and lost hopes. 
And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.
The moon is a loyal companion. It never leaves. It's always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it's a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human. Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections.
The fact that I'm silent doesn't mean I have nothing to say. 
No matter how careful you are, there's going to be the sense you missed something, the collapsed feeling under your skin that you didn't experience it all. There's that fallen heart feeling that you rushed right through the moments where you should've been paying attention.
I have come to accept the feeling of not knowing where I am going. And I have trained myself to love it. Because it is only when we are suspended in mid-air with no landing in sight, that we force our wings to unravel and alas begin our flight. And as we fly, we still may not know where we are going to. But the miracle is in the unfolding of the wings. You may not know where you're going, but you know that so long as you spread your wings, the winds will carry you. 
It's so hard to forget pain, but it's even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace. 
What we can or cannot do, what we consider possible or impossible, is rarely a function of our true capability. It is more likely a function of our beliefs about who we are. 
I think too deeply about everything. I still don't know if that allows me to see more of the world, or less of it. 
We're all so desperate to be understood, we forget to be understanding. 
Sleep is the most innocent creature there is and a sleepless man is the most guilty. 
But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.
Words never mean what we want them to mean.
You can never completely know anyone, no matter how well you think you do. There will always be some truth about them you don't ever get to know.
The meeting of two personalities is like the contact of two chemical substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed. 
How I wish I could hug everyone and tell them that it's okay. It's okay to be scared and angry and hurt and selfish. It's part of being human. 
I guess my life hasn't always been happy, or easy, or exactly what I wanted. At a certain point, I just have to try not to think too much about certain things, or else they'll break my heart. 
I have learned now that while those who speak about one's miseries usually hurt, those who keep silence hurt more. 
I do my best thinking at night when everyone else is sleeping. No interruptions. No noise. I like the feeling of being awake when no one else is.
You need to fight your mind every time it tries to convince you that you are: not good enough, criticized, too serious, not interesting, not wanted, excluded, rejected, or laughed at. 
If pain must come, may it come quickly. Because I have a life to live, and I need to live it in the best way possible.
Sometimes you have to lose all you have to find out who you truly are.
There are some values that you should never compromise on to stay true to yourself; you should be brave to stand up for what you truly believe in even if you stand alone.
Make the most of the best and the best of the worst, and keep your standards high. Never settle for anything less than you deserve or are capable of achieving.
Closing your eyes isn't going to change anything. Nothing's going to disappear just because you can't see what's going on. In fact, things will even be worse the next time you open your eyes. That's the kind of world we live in. Keep your eyes wide open. Only a coward closes his eyes. Closing your eyes and plugging up your ears won't make time stand still.
It's not selfish to do whatever is best for yourself. 
We're so caught up in our everyday lives that events of the past, like ancient stars that have burned out, are no longer in orbit around our minds. There are just too many things we have to think about every day, too many new things we have to learn. New styles, new information, new technology, and new terminology â€¦ But still, no matter how much time passes, no matter what takes place in the interim, there are some things we can never assign to oblivion, memories we can never rub away. They remain with us forever, like a touchstone.
Every one of us is losing something precious to us. Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back again. That's part of what it means to be alive. 
What makes us the most normal, is knowing that we're not normal.
I think we all wish we could erase some dark times in our lives. But all of life's experiences, bad and good, make you who you are. Erasing any of life's experiences would be a great mistake. 
There is hope, even when your brain tells you there isn't.
Endings are not bad things. They just mean that something else is about to begin. 
I felt like crying but nothing came out. It was just a sort of sad sickness, sick sad, when you can't feel any worse. I think you know it. I think everybody knows it now and then. But I think I have known it pretty often, too often. 
If you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people. 
In spite of everything, I still believe people are really good at heart.
The thing is, being lonely is like walking in the cold without a coat. It's uncomfortable, but eventually you go numb. Once you get used to not being lonely, though, the shock of going back is like having your down comforter yanked off at six o'clock on a Minnesota December morning.
The answer is dreams. Dreaming on and on. Entering the world of dreams and never coming out. Living in dreams for the rest of time. 
If you were born with the weakness to fall, you were born with the strength to rise.
The world gives you so much pain and here you are making gold out of it â€” there is nothing purer than that.
You cannot change what you are, only what you do.
I like people who have a sense of individuality. I love expression and anything awkward and imperfect, because that's natural and that's real. 
It's spring, you're young, you're lovely, you have a right to be happy. Come back into the world.
Nothing that's worthwhile is ever easy. Remember that.
There are some things about myself I can't explain to anyone. There are some things I don't understand at all. I can't tell what I think about things or what I'm after. I don't know what my strengths are or what I'm supposed to do about them. But if I start thinking about these things in too much detail the whole thing gets scary. And if I get scared I can only think about myself. I become really self
And then I felt sad because I realized that once people are broken in certain ways, they can't ever be fixed, and this is something nobody ever tells you when you are young and it never fails to surprise you as you grow older as you see the people in your life break one by one. You wonder when your turn is going to be, or if it's already happened.
Maybe you have to know the darkness before you can appreciate the light. 
If you can't do great things, do small things in a great way. 
I don't feel particularly proud of myself. But when I walk alone in the woods or lie in the meadows, all is well.
We are all a people in need. We are not perfect. We are not machines. We make mistakes. We need grace. We need compassion. We need help at times. We need other people. And that's okay. 
Time is irreversible, because some things are only meant to be felt once. Mistakes are vital in the process of being human, fortunately for us, there is hope; a possibility that if we're given that moment again, chances are we'll do it right. 
In certain areas of my life, I actively seek out solitude. Especially for someone in my line of work, solitude is, more or less, an inevitable circumstance. Sometimes, however, this sense of isolation, like acid spilling out of a bottle, can unconsciously eat away at a person's heart and dissolve it. You could see it, too, as a kind of double
Who are you to judge the life I live? I know I'm not perfect â€” and I don't live to be â€” but before you start pointing fingers, make sure you hands are clean! 
There are epic love stories that end in tragedy and then there are people who just float at a baseline of emotion. No love, no loss. I think it's better to experience it all; everything good, bad and terrifyingly ugly in this world. Otherwise, we'll just walk around numb, and what kind of life is that? 
There is a terrible emptiness in me, an indifference that hurts.
The sharpest minds often ruin their lives by overthinking the next step, while the dull win the race with eyes closed. 
Most people are not looking for provable truths. As you said, truth is often accompanied by intense pain, and almost no one is looking for painful truths. What people need is beautiful, comforting stories that make them feel as if their lives have some meaning.
In other words, let's face it: Life is basically unfair. But even in a situation that's unfair, I think it's possible to seek out a kind of fairness. Of course, that might take time and effort. And maybe it won't seem to be worth all that. It's up to each individual to decide whether or not it is.
Sometimes all a person wants is an empathetic ear; all he or she needs is to talk it out. Just offering a listening ear and an understanding heart for his or her suffering can be a big comfort. 
I have a very old and very faithful attachment for dogs. I like them because they always forgive.
I want excitement; and I don't care what form it takes or what I pay for it, so long as it makes my heart beat. 
So, what if, instead of thinking about solving your whole life, you just think about adding additional good things. One at a time. Just let your pile of good things grow. 
I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.
You need to spend time crawling alone through shadows to truly appreciate what it is to stand in the sun. 
There is a different between solitude and isolation. One is connected and one isn't. Solitude replenishes, isolation diminishes. 
I find the best way to love someone is not to change them, but instead, help them reveal the greatest version of themselves. 
I appreciate your concern. None of this is your fault. It's me. It's me and my head. 
I will not have you without the darkness that hides within you. I will not let you have me without the madness that makes me. If our demons cannot dance, neither can we. 
The body needs to create too. Beware feeling you're not good enough to deserve it. Beware feeling you're too good to need it. Beware all the hatred you've stored up inside you, and the locks tender places. 
Respect other people's feelings. It might mean nothing to you, but it could mean everything to them. 
The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.
Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to you can achieve on your journey through life, except in what your mind.
It is okay to be at a place of struggle. Struggle is just another word for growth. Even the most evolved beings find themselves in a place of struggle now and then. In fact, struggle is a sure sign to them that they are expanding; it is their indication of real and important progress. The only one who doesn't struggle is the one who doesn't grow. So if you are struggling right now, see it as a terrific sign â€” and celebrate your struggle. 
It's only after you've stepped outside your comfort zone that you begin to change, grow, and transform. 
To make a difference in someone's life, you don't have to be brilliant, rich, beautiful or perfect. You just have to care. 
You deserve to need me, not have me.
If there's one thing I've learned, it's this: We all want everything to be okay. We don't even wish so much for fantastic or marvelous or outstanding. We will happily settle for okay, because most of the time, okay is enough.
Don't let the expectations and opinions of other people affect your decisions. It's your life, not theirs. Do what matters most to you; do what makes you feel alive and happy. Don't let the expectations and ideas of others limit who you are. If you let others tell you who you are, you are living their reality â€“ not yours. There is more to life than pleasing people. There is much more to life than following others' prescribed path. There is so much more to life than what you experience right now. You need to decide who you are for yourself. Become a whole being. Adventure. 
But who can say what's best? That's why you need to grab whatever chance you have of happiness where you find it, and not worry about other people too much. My experience tells me that we get no more than two or three such chances in a life time, and if we let them go, we regret it for the rest of our lives.
A moment lasts all of a second, but the memory lives on forever. 
Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself.
Every one of us is losing something precious to us. Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back again. That's part of what it means to be alive. 
Someday, somewhere â€” anywhere, unfailingly, you'll find yourself, and that, and only that, can be the happiest or bitterest hour of your life. 
I've been searching for ways to heal myself, and I've found that kindness is the best way. 
For a dreamer, night's the only time of the day. 
That is why I write â€” to try to turn sadness into longing, solitude into remembrance. 
I think that's what's wrong with the world; no one says what they really feel, they always hold it inside. They're sad, but they don't cry. They're happy, but they don't dance or sing. They're angry, but they don't scream. Because if they do, they feel ashamed and that's the worst feeling in the world. So everyone walks with their heads down and no one sees how beautiful the sky is... 
I can't make you understand. I can't make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I can't even explain it to myself.
What I like about photographs is that they capture a moment that's gone forever, impossible to reproduce. 
We are all different. Don't judge, understand instead. 
Our generation thinks it's cool not to care. It's not. Effort is cool. Caring is cool. Staying loyal is cool. Try it out. 
Don't let someone who gave up on their dreams talk you out of yours. 
The great thing about this life of ours is that you can be someone different to anybody.
But what is memory if not the language of feeling, a dictionary of faces and days and smells which repeat themselves like the verbs and adjectives in a speech, sneaking in behind the thing itself,into the pure present, making us sad or teaching us vicariously. 
Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right. 
When things break, it's not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again. It's because a little piece gets lost 
Anybody can look at you. It's quite rare to find someone who sees the same world you see.
Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to you can achieve on your journey through life, except in what your mind.
Hoping for the best, prepared for the worst, and unsurprised by anything in between.
Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet. 
Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent. 
I don't trust anyone who doesn't laugh. 
You are the sum total of everything you've ever seen, heard, eaten, smelled, been told, forgot it's all there. Everything influences each of us, and because of that I try to make sure that my experiences are positive. 
The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had. 
I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt on both hands; you need to be able to throw something back. 
What you're supposed to do when you don't like a thing is change it. If you can't change it, change the way you think about it. Don't complain.
Every great dream begins with a dreamer. Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world. 
You can have anything in life if you will sacrifice everything else for it.
Every soul bleeds. Every soul hurts. Not like a skin cut, but deeper and stronger. It wounds us in a way we have never felt before. 
Tell me darling, would you still love me If I told you about the monsters I need to sing to sleep every night? If you understood the way I need to tiptoe across my own mind so I can fall asleep before daylight? If you knew where the nightmares came from, if you saw my scarred soul, would being with me terrify you? If you knew the full extent of the damage they have done to me, would you stay, would you still want to?
The heart is so tired of beating herself up, she wants to stop it still, but also she wants the blood to return, wants to bring in the thrill and wind of the ride, the fast pull of life driving underneath her.
I make myself come alive in my happy instinct for destruction.
I'm guilty of giving people more chances than they deserve but when I'm done, I'm done. 
Let me tell you this: if you meet a loner, no matter what they tell you, it's not because they enjoy solitude. It's because they have tried to blend into the world before, and people continue to disappoint them.
If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.
If you are chronically down, it is a lifelong fight to keep from sinking.
I have this strange feeling that I'm not myself anymore. It's hard to put in words, but I guess it's like I was fast asleep, and someone came, disassembled me, and hurriedly put me back together again. That sort of feeling.
Sometimes the most beautiful people are beautifully broken. 
Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain. 
You're the kind of soul anyone would be lucky to be with, and you don't even know it, the great ones never do. 
We must understand that sadness is an ocean, and sometimes we drown, while other days we are forced to swim. 
Keep love in your heart. A life without it, is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead. 
Loving me isn't easy. I have sharp edges; I have missing parts. 
The flower does not see its own beauty.
Words don't come out when you're hurt that deeply. 
I happen to like the strange ones. People who look normal and leads normal lives â€“ they're the ones you have to watch out for.
And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.
I don't care what you do to me, but I don't want you to hurt me. I've had enough hurt already in my life. More than enough. Now I want to be happy. 
Some things in life are out of your control. You can make it a party or a tragedy.
I hope you find someone you can't live without. I really do. And I hope you never have to know what it's like to have to try and live without them.
It's a dark place, not knowing. It's difficult to surrender to. But I guess it's where we live most of the time. I guess it's where we all live, so maybe it doesn't have to be so lonely. Maybe I can settle into it, cozy up to it, make a home inside uncertainty.
I've been hurt so bad and I still love so hard. I admire my heart for that.
I have discovered that insanity and writing are not much different; Insanity is just more bearable past midnight. 
Nobody else will ever be able to save me if I'm not fighting as hard as I can to save myself.
What a terrible feeling to love someone and not be able to help them.
The more you look into and understand yourself, the less judgmental you become towards others. 
When you stand in front of me and look at me, what do you know of the griefs that are in me and what do I know of yours? And if I were to cast myself down before you and weep and tell you, what more would you know about me than you know about Hell when someone tells you it is hot and dreadful? For that reason alone we human beings ought to stand before one another as reverently, as reflectively, as lovingly, as we would before the entrance to Hell. 
If you don't imagine, nothing ever happens at all. 
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them. 
But the heart has its own memory and I have forgotten nothing.
What matters is deciding in your heart to accept another person completely. When you do that, it is always the first time and the last.
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, and therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.
Just when you think it can't get any worse, it can. And just when you think it can't get any better, it can.
I am still learning. 
Words that come from the heart are never spoken, they get caught in the throat and can only be read in one's eyes. 
I am a collection of dismantled almost.
I feel very small. I don't understand. I have so much courage, fire, energy, for many things, yet I get so hurt, so wounded by small things.
I'm in pain because the day is ending and somehow I am never healing.
Suddenly she realized that what she was regretting was not the lost past but the lost future, not what had not been but what would never be.
I'm not everything I want to be, but I'm more than I was, and I'm still learning.
I understand that nobody understands me, but I can't be someone I'm not. 
If ever you were in the vicinity of a loner, you might believe there is tranquility in solitude, but if ever you were a loner, you know solitude is an escape from the pandemonium in a world that never could hear you screaming. 
You were hurt badly, and those scars will be with you for ever. I feel sorry for you, I really do. But think of it like this: it's not too late to recover. You're young, you're tough. You're adaptable. You can patch up your wounds, lift up your head and move on.
That is my story, simply told. Please do not ask again. I have told you in order to issue a warning. I have been damaged. Damaged people are dangerous. They know they can survive.
You are your own worst enemy. It is your negative thoughts that hold you back, nothing else. 
Love is a choice. It's not something that just happens to us, but something that we actively decide to give and receive. It requires effort, commitment, and sacrifice, but it can also bring great rewards. 
Just remember that, sometimes, the way you think about a person isn't the way they actually areâ€¦
It takes ten times as long to put yourself together as it does to fall apart.
Without music, life would be a mistake.
Everyone says love hurts, but that is not true. Loneliness hurts. Rejection hurts. Losing someone hurts. Envy hurts. Everyone gets these things confused with love, but in reality love is the only thing in this world that covers up all pain and makes someone feel wonderful again. Love is the only thing in this world that does not hurt. 
Please, I want so badly for the good things to happen. 
Never let fear and stupid pride make you lose someone who's precious to you.
The sad truth is that certain types of things can't go backward. Once they start going forward, no matter what you do, they can't go back the way they were. If even one little thing goes awry, then that's how it will stay forever. 
Life is too short to waste your time on people who don't respect, appreciate, and value you.
I believe that suffering is part of the narrative, and that nothing really good gets built when everything's easy. I believe that loss and emptiness and confusion often give way to new fullness and wisdom. 
I mean, say that you figure that everything is senseless, then it can't be quite senseless because you are aware that it's senseless and your awareness of senselessness almost gives it sense. You know what I mean?
True love is rare, and it's the only thing that gives life real meaning.
Accept yourself as you are. And that is the most difficult thing in the world, because it goes against your training, education, your culture. From the very beginning you've been told how you should be; nobody has ever told you that you are good as you are. 
What is the biggest thing that stops people from living their lives in the present moment? Fear â€” and we must learn how to overcome fear. 
Time is tricky. You have whole months, even years, when nothing changes a speck, when you don't go anywhere or do anything or think one new thought. And then you can get hit with a day, or an hour, or a half a second when so much happens it's almost like you got born all over again into some brand
There are some things about myself I can't explain to anyone. There are some things I don't understand at all. I can't tell what I think about things or what I'm after. I don't know what my strengths are or what I'm supposed to do about them. But if I start thinking about these things in too much detail the whole thing gets scary.
It's not just other people we need to forgive. We also need to forgive ourselves. For all the things we didn't do. All the things we should have done. 
It doesn't matter how many people you meet in your life; you just need the real ones who accept you for who you are and help you become who you should be. 
As we go through life we gradually discover who we are, but the more we discover, the more we lose ourselves.
Please remember: things are not what they seem.
I was always hungry for love. Just once, I wanted to know what it was like to get my fill of it â€” to be fed so much love I couldn't take any more. Just once. 
I close my eyes, but I can't fall asleep, my body dying for rest while my mind's wide awake.
Instead of saying I'm damaged, I'm broken, I have trust issues say I'm healing, I'm rediscovering myself, I'm starting over. 
The nice part about being a pessimist is that you are constantly being either proven right or pleasantly surprised. 
Music seems to hold everything together. It seems to make things not so chaotic sometimes. It seems to make things make more sense sometimes. 
Forget everything. Open the windows. Clear the room. The wind blows through it. You see only its emptiness, you search in every corner and don't find yourself.
For the moment I am really very, very tired of everything â€” more than tired. 
I want to calm down, to rest, to outlive this nonsense. 
We have calcium in our bones, iron in our veins, carbon in our souls, and nitrogen in our brains. 93 percent stardust, with souls made of flames, we are all just stars that have people names. 
I must change my life so that I can live it, not wait for it. 
Nobody can teach me who I am. You can describe parts of me, but who I am, and what I need, is something I have to find out myself. 
I still look back on those evenings we spent together as the happiest part of my life, and I wanted it to go on forever. 
I think you lost all interest in this world. You were disappointed and discouraged, and lost interest in everything. So you abandoned your physical body. You went to a world apart and you're living a different kind of life there. In a world inside you.
Not everyone likes me but not everyone matters. 
As soon as healing takes place, go out and heal someone else. 
I had a weird, empty feeling inside me. Not a bad sort of empty. It was a sort of lack of sensation, like being in pain for a long time and then suddenly realizing that you're not anymore.
It's okay if I'm not your favorite chapter you have written, but I hope you sometimes smile when you flip back to the pages I was still apart of. 
If you feel lost, you just have to start trying anything and everything. Only action brings change. You can't just sit there and overthink it. 
In my eyes, good conversation is the birthplace of true attraction. So open up and share with me every encounter and experience that shaped you into who you are today. Tell me all about your hopes and dreams and captivate me with your passions. Arouse my curiosity and you'll have my attention. 
The thing I'm most afraid of is me. Of not knowing what I'm going to do. Of not knowing what I'm doing right now.
I see myself forever and ever as the ridiculous person, the lonely soul, the wanderer, the restless frustrated artist, the person in love with love, always in search of the absolute, always seeking the unattainable. 
I felt utterly alone, like I was the last person alive on Earth. I can't describe that feeling of total loneliness. I just wanted to disappear into thin air and not think about anything.
Take care not to invest all of your strength and energy on keeping up appearances or disguising your insecurities when what's really essential to projecting a secure, confident presence is developing a healthy self-esteem and a kind and courageous heart. 
I'm not all that smart. It takes me a while to understand things. But if I do have the time, I will come to understand you â€” better than anyone else in the world.
I'm the kind of person who likes to be by himself. To put a finer point on it, I'm the type of person who doesn't find it painful to be alone.
Maybe our favorite quotations say more about us than about the stories and people we're quoting. 
Most people carry that pain around inside them their whole lives, until they kill the pain by other means, or until it kills them. But you, my friends, you found another way: a way to use the pain. To burn it as fuel, for light and warmth. You have learned to break the world that has tried to break you. 
I have a mind like ocean waves. Shifting always, too violent or too gentle, burning like salt water. Come too close and I worry that I will swallow you.
Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside of you that is greater than any obstacle. 
Whatever someone you become, and wherever you are in the world, I'm sending you love. You're my friend to the end. 
You go your way, I'll go your way too. 
You remember your first love because they show you, prove to you, that you can love and be loved, that nothing in this world is deserved except for love, that love is both how you become a person and why.
Did I really want to stay on this road longer, knowing it was only going to end in devastation? 
When people walk away from you, let them go. Your destiny is never tied to someone who leaves you. And it doesn't mean they are bad people, it just means that their part in your story is over. 
Scare the world: Be exactly who you say you are and tell the truth. 
Letting go. Everyone talks about it like it's the easiest thing. Unfurl your fingers one by one until your hand is open. But my hand has been clenched into a fist forâ€¦ years now; it's frozen shut. 
Falling asleep is a kinda crazy. You just lay there until you lose consciousness. If you think about it you can't sleep. You can lay down. You can close your eyes. But you can't sleep, it just happens. 
He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same. 
Soon you'll realize that many people will love the idea of you but will lack the maturity to handle the reality of you. 
It's weird to feel like you miss someone you're not even sure you know.
I wish I could freeze this moment, right here, right now and live in it forever. 
Living in the past won't save you from the future. 
You'll likely end up disappointed if you think people will care for you the way you care for them. Not everybody has your heart. 
The term 
The mind can't explain it, and you can't make it go away. It's called love.
I'm sorry. I know you've been looking for something and this isn't it. 
I want to rest. I want to breathe quietly again. 
The universe is seeming really huge right nowâ€¦ I need something to hold on to. 
We met at the wrong time. That's what I keep telling myself anyway. Maybe one day years from now, we'll meet in a coffee shop in a faraway city somewhere and we could give it another shot. 
My father had taught me to be nice first, because you can always be mean later, but once you've been mean to someone, they won't believe the nice anymore. So be nice, be nice, until it's time to stop being nice, then destroy them. 
You can love someone so much. But if they don't want to be saved, nothing will save them. Not even love. 
Photography is an art of observation. It has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them 
You will always struggle with not feeling productive until you accept that your own joy can be something you produce. It is not the only thing you will make, nor should it be, but it is something valuable and beautiful.
I am longing to be with you, and by the sea, where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air.
Maybe experiencing death once doesn't prepare you for experiencing it again. Death isn't something you can practice.
If you don't fight for what you want, don't cry for what you lost. 
I can tell you're not yourself lately and I hope wherever you've gone, you feel free. 
You must write, and read, as if your life depends on it. 
I am both worse and better than you thought.
I feel myself shutting down, closing off, like I should tell people, No, we don't use this heart anymore. It's too fragile.
Marianne had the sense that her real life was happening somewhere very far away, happening without her, and she didn't know if she would ever find out where it was or become part of it.
Let the water settle; you will see the moon and stars mirrored in your being. 
Dreams are only dreams until you wake up and make them real.
The world is made up of people who try for things and people who sit on the sidelines watching them.
I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.
You don't remember what happened. What you remember comes after what happened. 
And it's the most beautiful thing I've ever witnessed. That a creature like you exists in my world. 
I'll come around if you ever want to be in love. 
We need to forgive ourselves for all the things we didn't do. All the things we should have done. You can't get stuck on the regrets of what should have happened. 
I think part of the reason people take photos is because they're afraid that moment will never happen again. 
We are all ordinary. We are all boring. We are all shy. We are all bold. We are all heroes. We are all helpless. It just depends on the day. 
You rarely regret the things you do, but always the things you don't.
For a star to be born, there is one thing that must happen: a gaseous nebula must collapse. So collapse. Crumble. This is not your destruction. This is your birth. 
Don't think. It complicates things. Just feel, and if it feels like home, then follow its path. 
When you come back, you will not be you. And I may not be I. 
Saying nothing sometimes says the most. 
It's all right to love someone that doesn't love you back, as long as they're worth you loving them. As long as they deserve it. 
Because once you hear something, you can never return to the time before you heard it. 
I've always done whatever I felt like doing in life. People may try to stop me, and convince me I'm wrong, but I won't change.
True love stories never have endings. 
I'm attracted to the extreme light and the extreme dark. I'm interested in the human condition and what makes people tick. I'm interested in the things people try to hide. 
You don't need to force yourself to like me; I don't even like myself much.
She was the kind of person who took care of things by herself. She'd never ask anybody for advice or help. It wasn't a matter of pride, I think. She just did what seemed natural to her. 
People often ask me questions that I cannot very well answer in words, and it makes me sad to think they are unable to hear the voice of my silence. 
I mustn't look at you too much, or I won't be able to take my eyes off you at all. 
You're important to me. I think if there's anything that will last forever, it's that. Whether we separate, stay in touch or rarely speak again, you will always be that little someone I really do care for, that I would sacrifice everything for to protect and keep safe.
Truth is, the best revenge is seeking none at all and investing that energy in your own health and progress, prioritizing personal goals you've been neglecting, and working toward creating a passionate, prosperous and fulfilling future of your own.
When people don't express themselves, they die one piece at a time. You'd be shocked at how many adults are really dead inside â€” walking through their days with no idea who they are.
Nothing is quite as beautiful as someone who has survived losing everything and still has a tender heart. 
Probably someone should take this girl in his arms and hold her tight, I thought. Probably someone other than me. Someone qualified to give her something. 
You can keep as quiet as you like, but one of these days somebody is going to find you.
I am not actually tired, but numb and heavy, and can't find the right words. 
Being quiet doesn't always signify weakness. Sometimes it takes great strength to find that silence. Sometimes it takes incredible strength to survive.
I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. 
Sometimes its the small things that give us hope and make life bearable.
You must allow yourself to outgrow and depart from certain eras of your life with a gentle sort of ruthlessness. 
You'll ache. And you're going to love it. It will crush you. And you're still going to love all of it. Doesn't it sound lovely beyond belief?
Someone, somewhere, is searching for you in every person they meet. 
Home is where you feel at home. I'm still looking. 
Never forget that once upon a time, in an unguarded moment, you recognized yourself as a friend.
But it's nice to think so for a while, to think that childhood has its own sweet secrets and confirms mortality, and that mortality defines all courage and love. To think that what has looked forward must also look back, and that each life makes its own imitation of immortality: a wheel.
Before you find your soul mate, you must first discover your soul. 
What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?
Having confidence doesn't mean that people will automatically like you. It means that you believe in your purpose and you don't care if anyone in particular likes you or not. 
When you're a kid, you think your parents are invincible and all
You inspired me. For that, you are worth every inch of love I had to give.
Don't force someone to make time for you, if they really want to, they will. 
Fear can't hurt you. When it washes over you, give it no power. It's a snake with no venom. Remember that. That knowledge can save you.
Until you heal the wounds of your past, you are going to bleed. You can bandage the bleeding with food, with alcohol, with drugs, with work, with cigarettes, with sex; but eventually it will all ooze through and stain your life. You must find the strength to open the wounds, stick your hand inside, pull out the core of the pain that is holding you in your past the memories and make peace with them. 
I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hate so stubbornly is because they sense, once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with pain.
People believe exactly what they want to believe â€“ and they want most of all to believe in their own fears.
In the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years. 
People don't change, not inside. They may put on different masks, but they're always the same underneath.
No man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end in their nature and education. 
Love who you love while you have them. That's all you can do. Let them go when you must. If you know how to love, you'll never run out.
Maybe, the only thing that has to make sense about being somebody's friend is that you help them be their best self on any given day. That you give them a home when they don't want to be in their own.
You can blame yourself for anything if you think about it long enough. 
For the most part, you don't hold the people you love in your heart because they rescued you from drowning or pulled you from a burning house. Mostly you hold them in your heart because they save you, in a million quiet and perfect ways, from being alone.
It's hard to hate someone once you understand them. 
The first rule of any game was to assume you could win, even if you had to hunt through the universe's cracks for a strategy, even if you had to turn the pieces inside
All things are meltable, and replaceable. Not at this moment, but soon enough, we are lambs and we are leaves, and we are stars, and the shining, mysterious pond water itself.
If a man can look into himself and admit his limits, then his behavior towards his fellow man, the city, and nature is right. 
I knew I could be brave. I already had been for a very long time.
I used to imagine adventures for myself. I invented a life, so that I could at least exist somehow. 
I had no idea what I wanted, only that I wanted something, which is the worst kind of wanting. 
Don't let the concept of change scare you as much as the prospect of remaining unhappy. 
We often want it so badly that we ruin it before it begins. Overthinking. Fantasizing. Imagining. Expecting. Worrying. Doubting. Just let it naturally evolve. 
Sometimes people put up walls, not only to keep people out, but also to see who cares enough to tear them down.
Don't apologize for your feelings. Never apologize for those.
There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is not my nature. My attachments are always excessively strong.
A compass doesn't tell you where you are, and it doesn't tell you where you have to go. It can only point you in a direction. It's up to you to always find your true north.
I think there is beauty in everything. What normal people perceive as ugly, I can usually see something of beauty in it. 
So many versions of just one memory, and yet none of them were right or wrong. Instead, they were all pieces. Only when fitted together, edge to edge, could they even begin to tell the whole story.
I will surround you with a love too deep for words. 
I want to feel my life while I'm in it. 
Scared is what you're feeling. Brave is what you're doing. 
I do not believe that things will turn out well; but the idea that they might â€” that is of vital importance. 
Hope is a waking dream. 
Sometimes it's better not to look back. 
Be the type of person you want to meet. 
It had been a long day, and I don't mind saying that I cried a little bit. There is nothing wrong with crying at the end of a long day. 
It is hard to describe loss to someone who has never experienced it, impossible to explain all the ways it changes you. But for those who have, not a single word is needed.
Above all else, it is about leaving a mark that I existed: I was here. I was hungry. I was defeated. I was happy. I was sad. I was in love. I was afraid. I was hopeful. I had an idea and I had a good purpose and that's why I made works of art. 
It is true that I miss intelligent companionship, but there are so few with whom I can share the things that mean so much to me that I have learned to contain myself. It is enough that I am surrounded with beauty.
Everything that happens helps you grow, even if it's hard to see right now. 
Never settle for potential and promise. Words are only words until they are actions. Don't settle for less than what you deserve. 
Life, now, was unfolding before me, constantly and visibly, like the flowers of summer that drop fan-like petals on eternal soil.
If you can't win, you have to resist. 
You're always you, and that don't change, and you're always changing, and there's nothing you can do about it.
You can never visit the same place twice. Each time, it's a different story. By the very act of coming back, you wipe out what came before.
You never forget. It must be somewhere inside of you. Even if the brain has forgotten, perhaps the teeth remember. Or the fingers. 
You remind me of parts of myself that I will never have a chance to meet. 
You are never quite alone when you are in a bookstore. So many voices are jammed into one place, it's impossible to feel alone.
Anyone who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is to be poor.
If I had words to speak such a thing, I would have. But there were none that seemed big enough for it, to hold that swelling truth.
If speaking kindly to plants can help them grow, just imagine what speaking kindly to humans can do. 
And when old words die out on the tongue, new melodies break forth from the heart; and where the old tracks are lost, new country is revealed with its wonders. 
The way you can memorize someone's gestures but never know their thoughts. And the feeling that people are like house with vast rooms and tiny windows. The way you can feel so exposed, anyway.
When a question has no correct answer, there is only one honest response. The gray area between yes and no. Silence.
The fact is that five years ago I was, as near as possible, a different person to what I am tonight. I, as I am now, didn't exist at all. Will the same thing happen in the next five years? I hope so. 
Some people have a million hearts while others have none. 
There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven't recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can't decipher. what we can't understand we call nonsense. What we can't read we call gibberish. There is no free will. There are no variables. 
Pain changes us in a way that can be either great or destructive. In both cases the change can't be undone. 
Don't lose yourself. Know your worth. Leave what isn't for you. Save space for people who matter. 
These are the days that must happen to you. 
Despite what your brain is telling you, you don't have all the time in the world. One day you'll wonder where all that time went.
The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts. 
In oneself lies the whole world, and if you know how to look and learn, then the door is there and the key is in your hand. Nobody on earth can give you either that key or the door to open, except yourself. 
We were the wrong age for love and yet it was all we could think about. 
Once you are in a relationship you start taking each other for granted. That's what destroys all love affairs. The woman thinks she knows the man, the man thinks he knows the woman. Nobody knows either. It is impossible to know the other, the other remains a mystery. And to take the other for granted is insulting, disrespectful. 
There are all kinds of love in this world, but never the same love twice.
I think if what you'd do for your last day on Earth doesn't look like a pretty normal day for you, you probably need to reexamine your life.
The appearance of things changes according to the emotions, and thus we see magic and beauty in them, while the magic and beauty are really in ourselves. 
Don't look away. Look straight at everything. Look it all in the eye, good and bad. 
That's the nice thing about being human. We only have one life, but we can choose what kind of story it's going to be. 
People don't usually leave behind their life's work, but they also don't usually leave behind their families.
I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. 
I'd rather be hated for who I am, rather than be loved for who I am not. 
You'll end up really disappointed if you think people will do for you as you will do for them. Not everyone has the same heart as you. 
We do not condemn it because it is a crime, but it is a crime because we condemn it. 
Anyone who has actually been that sad can tell you that there's nothing beautiful or literary or mysterious about depression.
You know. Life's short. If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you're best at. And you can only make time or new things by quitting the things you know don't work for you. 
The thing is, when you lose someone, you realize you'll eventually lose everyoneâ€¦ And once you know that, you can never forget it.
Some words stay in your head long after they're spoken. 
I just wanted you to know there will be a piece of you in me. Always. 
Be with someone who makes your Mondays feel like Fridays. 
I hate men who are afraid of women's strength. 
Even when this world is a forgotten whisper of dust between the stars, I will always love you. 
I wanted to look ahead to where I was going, not back at what I was leaving, but then I turned anyway. 
I'm sorry to all the people I hurt whilst I was hurting. 
I hate this feeling. Like I'm here, but I'm not. Like someone cares. But they don't. Like I belong somewhere else, anywhere but here, and escape lies just past that snowy window, cool and crispâ€¦
Alone or not, you gotta walk forward. 
Perhaps it is true that we do not really exist until there is someone there to see us existing, we cannot properly speak until there is someone who can understand what we are saying in essence, we are not wholly alive until we are loved. 
No. Don't give up hope just yet. It's the last thing to go. When you have lost hope, you have lost everything. And when you think all is lost, when all is dire and bleak, there is always hope. 
I hope I haven't already driven past my greatest moments. I hope there is something beautiful on the horizon that's just as impatient as I am. Something so eager, It wants to meet me halfway.
We need, in love, to practice only this: letting each other go. For holding on comes easy; we do not need to learn it. 
Have you ever been in love? Horrible, isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.
The question is not what you look at, but what you see. 
Time is tricky. You have whole months, even years, when nothing changes a speck, when you don't go anywhere or do anything or think one new thought. And then you can get hit eight a day, or an hour, or a half a second when so much happens it's almost like you got born all over again into some brand-new person you for damn sure never expected to meet. 
There has to be a middle. Without it, nothing can ever truly be whole. Because it is not just the space between, but also what holds everything together.
There is love in holding on and there is love in letting go. 
I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things which I dare not confess to my own soul.
There is a kind of alchemy to it, when one human touches another and makes the aloneness less terrifying.
Sometimes you have to accept the fact that there are things that will never go back to how they used to be. 
Two souls don't find each other by simple accident. 
How wonderful it is, to be silent with someone. 
It's tough to get out of bed; I know that myself. You can lie there for an hour and a half without thinking anything, just worrying about what the day holds and knowing that you won't be able to deal with it.
There are years that ask questions and years that answer.
Say it before you run out of time. Say it before it's too late. Say what you're feeling. Waiting is a mistake. 
We are our own dragons as well as our own heroes, and we have to rescue ourselves from ourselves.
All change is not growth, as all movement is not forward. 
It's never too late while you're breathing.
The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to these things. You meet someone and you fall in love and that's that. 
True humility is not thinking less of yourself; it is thinking of yourself less. 
I will tell you what she was like. She was like a piano in a country where everyone has had their hands cut off. 
Sometimes it seemed to me like everyone I knew was wearing a mask, trying to hide who they really were. 
The image of the morning sun in a dewdrop is not less than the sun. The reflection of life in your soul is not less than life. 
Play me like I'm your favorite song. I know I might not be your favorite forever, but at least I was for a moment. 
A negative mind will never give you a positive life. 
I want to run into the foothills and scream into the canyons. I want my voice to echo and crack the ground beneath my feet.
It was the kind of kiss that made me know that I was never so happy in my whole life. 
Sometimes happiness looks like staying at home, minding your business, telling people no and doing you. 
A million dollars sounds like a lot, I know. Especially when you're young. But you can't let money erode your principles or you'll wind up with nothing.
We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word has been spoken.
I don't know how I can be so ambitious and so lazy at the same time.
Only the dead have seen the end of war. 
There are times to stay put, and what you want will come to you, and there are times to go out into the world and find such a thing for yourself. 
You have so many layers, that you can peel away a few, and everyone's so shocked or impressed that you're baring your soul, while to you it's nothing, because you know you've twenty more layers to go. 
I think the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him; he has created him in his own image and likeness. 
But that didn't mean those things weren't worth doing. Someone had to carry on with the small acts that kept civilization moving. And this time it was her turn.
Happiness is not a matter of intensity but of balance and order and rhythm and harmony. 
What does anyone know for certain except the sun will set tonight and come up tomorrow?
Most times, it's just a lot easier not to let the world know what's wrong.
Some words stay in your head long after they're spoken. 
Of course I'll hurt you. Of course you'll hurt me. Of course we will hurt each other. But this is the very condition of existence. To become spring, means accepting the risk of winter. To become presence, means accepting the risk of absence.
The shame of it was they both loved each other, but they were both too young to know how to love.
Write her a letter, send her a flower; love only gets old if you let it. 
May your love be modern enough to survive the times, but old-fashioned enough to last forever. 
Before you give up, think about why you held on for so long. 
When pain brings you down, don't be silly, don't close your eyes and cry; you just might be in the best position to see the sun shine. 
If you persistently seek validation from others, you will inadvertently invalidate your own self-worth. 
The state of your life is nothing more than a reflection of the state of your mind. 
Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love. I like to work, read, learn, and understand life. 
Every night I come to the same place and wait until the sky catches up with my mood. 
I don't really want to become normal, average, standard. I want merely to gain in strength, in the courage to live out my life more fully, enjoy more, experience more. I want to develop even more original and more unconventional traits. 
One heart is not connected to another through harmony alone. They are, instead, linked deeply through their wounds. Pain linked to pain, fragility to fragility. There is no silence without a cry of grief, no forgiveness without bloodshed, no acceptance without a passage through acute loss. That is what lies at the root of true harmony. 
The roots of all living things are tied together. Deep in the ground of being, they tangle and embrace. If we look deeply, we find that we do not have a separate self-identity, a self that does not include sun and wind, earth and water, creatures and plants, and one another. 
The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them. 
When something bothered me, I didn't talk with anyone about it. I thought it over all by myself, came to a conclusion, and took action alone. Not that I really felt lonely. I thought that's just the way things are. Human beings, in the final analysis, have to survive on their own. 
Halls are full of strangers, even when you recognize the faces. 
When I look at the world I'm pessimistic, but when I look at people I am optimistic. 
Until we have seen someone's darkness, we don't really know who they are. Until we have forgiven someone's darkness, we don't really know what love is. 
How strange it is. We have these deep terrible lingering fears about ourselves and the people we love. Yet we walk around, talk to people, eat and drink. We manage to function. The feelings are deep and real. Shouldn't they paralyze us? How is it we can survive them, at least for a little while? We drive a car, we teach a class. How is it no one sees how deeply afraid we were, last night, this morning? Is it something we all hide from each other, by mutual consent? Or do we share the same secret without knowing it? Wear the same disguise? 
I want to look back and say that I was alive. That I didn't turn my back. That I tried. That I was happy.
And then something invisible snapped insider her, and that which had come together commenced to fall apart.
You can pretend for a long time, but one day it all falls away and you are alone. We are alone in the most beautiful place in the world.
Because no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself.
A good test of a relationship is how well you both deal with challenges. If one person is more invested, it shows. If you're with the wrong person, it feels like too much work. But if you're unhappy more than you're happy, it's not the right relationship for you.
Make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to a man than a secure future.
The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. If you want to get more out of life, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a shelter
There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was happy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day. She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places. She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned to dream in. And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested. There were days when she was unhappy, she did not know whyâ€”when it did not seem worth while to be glad or sorry, to be alive or dead; when life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation. 
There are two kinds of people in this world: Those who believe there are two kinds of people in this world and those who are smart enough to know better.
Letting yourself get hurt isn't brave, love. Brave is protecting others from hurt.
People did change, and a change could be a bloom as well as a withering.
If you don't try at anything, you can't fail; it takes backbone to lead the life you want.
My point is, there are a lot of people in the world. No one ever sees everything the same way you do; it just doesn't happen. So when you find one person who gets a couple of things, especially if they're important ones, you might as well hold on to them. 
It was good, and nothing good is truly lost. It stays part of a person, becomes part of their character. So part of you goes everywhere with me. And part of me is yours, forever. 
Sometimes you need to lose yourself a few times before you can find yourself. 
This is your life and it's ending one moment at a time. 
It sucks that we miss people like that. You think you've accepted that someone is out of your life, that you've grieved and its over, and then bam. One little thing, and you feel like you've lost that person all over again. 
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on my way. 
Once you lose someone, it is never exactly the same person who comes back. 
I won't say it wasn't meant to be, because it was. We were. Only for a short while, maybe. But we were. 
In the end you can't always choose what to keep. You can only choose how you let it go. 
And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
When I'm with you, I don't breathe quite right. 
I like sleep. My life has a tendency to fall apart when I'm awake, you know? 
I didn't come this far to only come this far. 
We tell our stories differently, don't we, you and I? 
You and I knew strange corners of life. 
All the bright, precious things fade so fast. And they don't come back. 
The sad truth is that the truth is sad. 
Sometimes you don't get closure, you just move on. 
I know that you think that you're on your own. But just know that I'm here, and I'll lead you home if you let me. 
I knew it wasn't too important, but it made me sad anyway. 
I think about you but I don't say it anymore. 
When a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower. 
Old ways won't open new doors. 
If you don't belong, don't be long. 
I don't want you to look at me and feel nothing. 
I need to be alone. I need to ponder my shame and my despair in seclusion; I need the sunshine and the paving stones of the streets without companions, without conversation, face to face with myself, with only the music of my heart for company. 
You were unsure which pain is worse: the shock of what happened or the ache for what never will. 
The things that go unsaid are often the things that eat at you â€“ whether because you didn't get to have your say, or because the other person never got to hear you and really wanted to. 
I allow the truth to be the truth, no matter how much I might want it to be something else.
Brave doesn't mean you're not scared. It means you go on even though you're scared.
Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.
Sometimes people stop loving you. And that's the kind of darkness that never gets fixed, no matter how many moons rise again.
I want to look back and say that I was alive. That I didn't turn my back. That I tried. That I was happy.
However, I've learned that the heart can't be told when and who and how it should love. The heart does whatever the hell it wants to do. The only thing we can control is whether we give our lives and our minds the chance to catch up to our hearts.
Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.
Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.
Where the heart is really attached, I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of any body else.
You want to see people as extremes. Bad or good, trustworthy or not. I understand. It's easier that way. But that isn't how people work.
At an early age I learned that people make mistakes, and you have to decide if their mistakes are bigger than your love for them.
What I need and what I want are two very different things.
I always felt like I saw things differently. Saw things other people didn't.
By then I knew that everything good and bad left an emptiness when it stopped. But if it was bad, the emptiness filled up by itself. If it was good you could only fill it by finding something better. 
Too many people say something when they really have nothing to say.
It's our choices that matter in the end. Not wishes, not words, not promises.
Quitting is not hard. Deciding to quit is hard. Once you make that mental leap, the rest is easy.
Some things you can never leave behind. They don't belong to the past. They belong to you.
You should know, if you never open up you're never going to heal.
But how can you walk away from something and still come back to it?
Nights and days and days and nights, hundreds of them slipping through my fingers.
I was like a patient who cannot tell the doctor where it hurts, only that it does.
I was thinking how amazing it was that the world contained so many lives. Out in these streets people were embroiled in a thousand different matters, money problems, love problems, school problems. People were falling in love, getting married, going to drug rehab, learning how to ice
You ask everybody you know: How long does it usually take to get over it? There are many formulas. One year for every year you dated. Two years for every year you dated. It's just a matter of will power: The day you decide it's over, it's over. You never get over it.
You don't want to let go, but don't want to be hurt, either. It's not a great place to be but what can I tell you?
You'll understand why storms are named after people. 
You are not in love with me, not really, you just love the way I always made you feel. Like you were the center of my world. Because you were. I would have done anything for you. 
Once you know a thing you can't ever unknow it. 
Even those we love the most can be a poison to our souls. 
I've always liked the time before dawn because there's no one around to remind me who I am supposed to be, so it's easier to remember who I am. 
I can't think of any greater happiness than to be with you all the time. 
You can hate a place with all your heart and soul and still be homesick for it. 
Life is not like water. Things in life don't necessarily flow over the shortest possible route. 
The past is just a story we tell ourselves. 
It is very sad to me that some people are so intent on leaving their mark on the world that they don't care if that mark is a scar. 
Nothing haunts us like the things we don't say. 
I think its very healthy to spend time alone. You need to know how to be alone and not be defined by another person. 
A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for. 
I'm not saying that everything is survivable. Just that everything except the last thing is. 
They may not have loved you, but they did change you. They taught you. They grew you. 
Well, let it pass there are all kinds of love in the world, but never the same love twice. 
Things hardly ever work on the first try. We'll make another, a better one. 
Be a lamp, or a lifeboat, or a ladder. Help someone's soul heal. 
Thomas Edison's last words were: It's very beautiful over there. I don't know where there is, but I believe it's somewhere, and I hope it's beautiful. 
This is not goodbye, my darling, this is a thank you. Thank you for coming into my life and giving me joy, thank you for loving me and receiving my love in return. Thank you for the memories I will cherish forever. but most of all, thank you for showing me that there will come a time when I can eventually let you go. 
Perhaps we may meet each other in a dream. 
I might be no better, but at least I am different. 
There's still a piece of me that can't let go of you. 
I know that you think that you're on your own. But just know that I'm here, and I'll lead you home if you let me. 
Whatever someone you become, and wherever you are in the world, I'm sending you love. You're my friend to the end. 
You must go on adventures to find out where you belong. 
I've never been very good at leaving things behind. I tried, but I have always left fragments of myself there too, like seeds awaiting their chance to grow. 
I swear I only want to hear about you, to know what you've been doing. Its a hundred years since we've met it may be another hundred years before we meet again. 
Perhaps somewhere, some day, at a less miserable time, we may see each other again. 
I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that's why.
To the ones who still believe in dreams: Chase them. Chase them until you're out of breath. Then, keep running. 
I knew it wasn't too important, but it made me sad anyway. 
If anything, it is waiting waiting for better days, even better moments that makes life worth living. 
You get a strange feeling when you're about to leave a place. Like you'll not only miss the people you love but you'll miss the person you are now at this time and this place because you'll never be this way ever again. 
I don't want you to look at me and feel nothing. 
When a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower. 
One day the sky will crack open and the stars will pour out in waves of moonlight and there is your love. 
Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you are not taking advantage of it? 
There comes a point in a relationship when you realize that you trust someone enough to let them keep their secrets. 
Sometimes the most healing thing we can do is remind ourselves over and over and over: other people feel this too. 
Forgive yourself for not knowing what you didn't know before you learned it. 
There are some feelings you will never find words for; you will learn to name them after the ones who gave them to you. 
If only we could see the endless string of consequences that result from our smallest actions. But we can't know better until knowing better is useless. 
Sometimes suffering is just suffering. It doesn't make you stronger. It doesn't build character. It only hurts. 
We tell our stories differently, don't we, you and I? 
But in that moment I understood what they say about nostalgia, that no matter if you're thinking of something good or bad, it always leaves you a little emptier afterwards. 
There was nothing to talk about anymore. The only thing to do was go. 
I'm not used to being loved. I wouldn't know what to do. 
When you come back, you will not be you. And I may not be I. 
Don't think. It complicates things. Just feel, and if it feels like home, then follow its path. 
How wonderful it is, to be silent with someone. 
It was not the feeling of completeness I so needed, but the feeling of not being empty. 
We all go through phases in life. If you are not okay now, it's okay. You find your way. 
Close some doors today. Not because of pride, incapacity, or arrogance, but simply because they lead you nowhere. 
People don't always want to be with people. It gets tiring. 
You go your way, I'll go your way too. 
Be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. 
You are a minute of quiet in a loud shouting world. 
Whatever causes night in your soul may leave stars. 
I love that word. Forever. I love that forever doesn't exist, but we have a word for it and use it all the time. It's beautiful and doomed. 
Whatever happens tomorrow, we've had today. 
I feel myself shutting down, closing off, like I should tell people: No, we don't use this heart anymore. Its too fragile. 
I laughed and said: Life is easy. What I meant was, Life is easy with you here, and when you leave, it will be hard again. 
Almost. Its a big word for me. I feel it everywhere. Almost home. Almost happy. Almost changed. Almost, but not quite. Not yet. Soon, maybe. 
It had been a long day, and I don't mind saying that I cried a little bit. There is nothing wrong with crying at the end of a long day. 
Sometimes I can hear my bones straining under the weight of all the lives I'm not living. 
In my memory, it doesn't end. We just stay there, looking at each other, forever. 
Love isn't something you have to deserve. 
These mountains that you are carrying, you were only supposed to climb. 
I am simply thankful for your existence whether I am meant to be a part of it or not. 
We'll never be those kids again. 
If someone makes you feel, let them. 
And suddenly you know: Its time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. 
We pretend that we don't care. But we care. 
Just remember that sometimes, the way you think about a person isn't the way they actually are. 
People go, but how they left always stays. 
When I'm with you, I don't breathe quite right. 
Everyone is a main character to someone. 
A couple of times in your life, it happens like that. you meet a stranger, and all you know is that you need to know everything about them. 
I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again. 
How amazing it is to find someone who wants to hear about all the things that go on in your head. 
I didn't know what to call it, what was happening between us, but I liked it. It felt silly and fragile and good. 
Please don't expect me to always be good and kind and loving. There are times when I will be cold and thoughtless and hard to understand. 
I knew that what was left of me would always love you, but never in quite the same way. 
Don't ever think that everyone who leaves wants to. 
It's a frightening thought, that in one fraction of a moment you can fall in the kind of love that takes a lifetime to get over. 
As long as we don't die, this is gonna be one hell of a story. 
You can, you should, and if you're brave enough to start, you will. 
Sooner or later, I'm going to have to think about it and then I'm going to be a mess. 
The fact is that five years ago I was, as near as possible, a different person to what I am tonight. I, as I am now, didn't exist at all. Will the same thing happen in the next five years? I hope so. 
I'm sorry to all the people I hurt whilst I was hurting. 
All change is not growth, just as all movement is not forward. 
Apologize to your body. Maybe that is where the healing begins. 
That's the nice thing about being human. We only have one life, but we can choose what kind of story it's going to be. 
Letting go. Everyone talks about it like it's the easiest thing. Unfurling your fingers one by one until your hand is open. But my hand has been clenched into a fist for years now; it's frozen shut. 
A ship in harbor is safe, but that is not what ships are built for. 
You know. Life's short. If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you're best at. And you can only make time for new things by quitting the things you know don't work for you. 
I don't want just words. If that's all you have for me, you'd better go. 
I hope you will go out and let stories happen to you, and that you will work with these stories; water them with your blood and tears and your laughter till they bloom, till you yourself burst into bloom. 
The past is a place of reference, not a place of residence. 
Do you ever realize how badly you're going to miss a moment while you're living it? Like wow, these are the good days. I am here and I am happy and I am alive. 
The most painful thing is losing yourself in the process of loving someone too much and forgetting that you are special too. 
Some words stay in your head long after they're spoken. 
The sun will rise, and we will try again. 
This is what I like about photographs. They're proof that once, even if just for a heartbeat, everything was perfect. 
I used to build dreams about you. 
Just because things hadn't gone the way I had planned didn't necessarily mean they had gone wrong. 
There is a girl who still writes to you; she doesn't know how not to. 
You don't destroy people you care about. That's not how it works, that should never be an option. Choose laughter. Choose peace. Choose love. 
You must go on adventures to find out where you belong. 
And yet, you kept going. 
We are unusual and tragic and alive. 
There are a few things in life so beautiful they hurt: swimming in the ocean while it rains, reading alone in empty libraries, the sea of stars that appear when youâ€™re miles away from the neon lights of the city, bars after 2am, walking in the wilderness, all the phases of the moon, the things we do not know about the universeâ€¦ and you. 
Take me out tonight, because I want to see people and I want to see life. 
You are the universe, expressing itself as a human for a little while. 
You had to change to survive. 
You cannot use someone else's fire. You can only use your own. And in order to do that, you must first be willing to believe that you have it. 
Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you are not taking advantage of it? 
There are different ways of loving, aren't there? 
You had to be that person to become this one. 
I laughed and said, â€˜Life is easy.â€™ What I meant was, â€˜Life is easy with you here, and when you leave, it will be hard again.â€™ 
I've never been very good at leaving things behind. I tried, but I have always left fragments of myself there too, like seeds awaiting their chance to grow. 
Stop shrinking to fit places youâ€™ve outgrown. 
Donâ€™t you ever give up hope. Not today. Not tomorrow. You were born with an infinite imagination. If one dream is shattered, pick up the pieces you can and create a new dream. Yes, reinventing yourself takes grit. But youâ€™ve got that too. 
Breathe. This is just a chapter. Not the whole story. 
Do not run away from the heavy emotions. Honor the anger. Give pain the space it needs to breathe. This is how we let go. 
What lies behind you and what lies in front of you, pales in comparison to what lies inside of you. 
When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hang on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. 
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. 
I canâ€™t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination. 
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched they must be felt with the heart. 
Do your little bit of good where you are; itâ€™s those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world. 
I think anything is possible if you have the mindset and the will and desire to do it and put the time in. 
It is not true that people stop pursuing dreams when they grow old. They grow old when they stop pursuing dreams. 
When you wake up every day, you have two choices. You can either be positive or negative; an optimist or a pessimist. I choose to be an optimist. Itâ€™s all a matter of perspective. 
No matter what youâ€™re going through, thereâ€™s a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and youâ€™ll find the positive side of things. 
I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose. There are no accidents; weâ€™re all teachers if weâ€™re willing to pay attention to the lessons we learn, trust our positive instincts and not be afraid to take risks or wait for some miracle to come knocking at our door. 
Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines. 
Change your life today. Donâ€™t gamble on the future, act now, without delay. 
If you fell down yesterday, stand up today. 
Work hard for what you want because it wonâ€™t come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive. 
The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do. 
Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose. 
Set your goals high, and donâ€™t stop till you get there. 
Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star. 
I donâ€™t believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be. 
Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better. 
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. 
When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor. 
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. 
Donâ€™t watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going. 
Real love doesnâ€™t meet you at your best. It meets you in your mess. 
Progress. Just make progress. Itâ€™s okay to have setbacks and the need for do-overs. Itâ€™s okay to draw a line in the sand and start over again and again. Just make sure youâ€™re moving the line forward. Move forward. Take baby stepsâ€¦ Then change will come. And it will be good. 
Never look at another personâ€™s life and then think that you are not enough. You are more than enough for the right people. 
The life in front of you is way more important than the life behind you. 
Just because youâ€™re struggling, doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re failing. 
Not everyone you love will stay. Not everyone you trust will be loyal. Some people only exist as an example of what to avoid. 
Life is not about who you once were. Itâ€™s about who you are right now, and who you have the potential to become. 
So I close my eyes to old ends and open my heart to new beginnings. 
Nobody is worth losing yourself for. 
Youâ€™ll likely end up disappointed if you think people will care for you the way you care for them. Not everyone has your heart. 
And even if we never talk again, please remember that Iâ€™m forever changed by who you are and what you meant to me. 
Sometimes we need someone to simply be there. Not to fix anything, or to do anything in particular but just to let us feel that we are cared for and supported. 
Donâ€™t grieve for what doesnâ€™t come. Some things that donâ€™t happen keep disasters from happening. 
Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. Itâ€™s self-destruction. 
I wonâ€™t let pain turn my heart into something ugly. I will show you that surprising can be beautiful. 
There is nothing in this world that can trouble you more than your own thoughts. 
Start now. Start where you are. Start with fear. Start with pain. Start with doubt. Start with hands shaking. Start with voice trembling but start. Start and donâ€™t stop. Start where you are, with what you have. Justâ€¦ start. 
Stop apologizing. You donâ€™t have to say sorry for how you laugh, how you dress, how you make your hair, how you speak. You donâ€™t have to be sorry for being yourself. Do it fearlessly. Itâ€™s time to accept this is you, and you gotta spend the rest of your life with you. So start loving your sarcasm, your awkwardness, your weirdness, your unique sense of humor, your everything. It will make your life so much easier to simply be yourself. 
She was never quite ready. But she was brave. And the universe listens to brave. 
Love yourself enough to take the actions required for your happiness â€¦ enough to cut yourself loose from the drama-filled past â€¦ enough to set a high standard for relationships â€¦enough to feed your mind and body in a healthy manner â€¦ enough to forgive yourself â€¦ enough to move on. 
My biggest regrets in life are being too damn nice, apologizing when I didnâ€™t do anything wrong, and making unworthy people a priority in my life. 
The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. 
The work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die. 
Never apologize for burning too brightly or collapsing into yourself every night. That is how galaxies are made. 
Try a little harder to be a little better. 
Maybe someday we will be two people meeting again for the first time. 
The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive. 
Some steps need to be taken alone. Itâ€™s the only way to really figure out where you need to go and who you need to be. 
Donâ€™t say maybe if you want to say no. 
I admire people who choose to smile after all the things theyâ€™ve been through. 
Long after youâ€™ve forgotten someoneâ€™s voice, you can still remember the sound of their happiness or their sadness. You can feel it in your body. 
I can love only what I can place so high above me that I cannot reach it. 
Educate yourself. When a question about a certain topic pops up, google it. Watch movies and documentaries. When something sparks your interest, read about it. Read, read, read. Study, learn, stimulate your brain. Donâ€™t just rely on the school system, educate that beautiful mind of yours. 
She couldnâ€™t hold so much life, light and joy without also containing their opposites.
Some words stay in your head long after they're spoken.
You are going to live a good and long life filled with great and terrible moments that you cannot even begin to imagine yet.
